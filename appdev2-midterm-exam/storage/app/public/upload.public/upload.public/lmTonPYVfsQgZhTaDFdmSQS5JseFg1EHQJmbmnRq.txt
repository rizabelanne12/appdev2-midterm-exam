Enumerate the type of Human Memory.
Long-term Memory- holds information over an extended period of time, ranging from minutes to a lifetime.
short-term Memory - is used to temporarily store information while we are performing a task, such as solving a problem or making a decision. 
Sensory Memory- This type of memory holds information from our senses (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell) for a brief period of time, typically less than a second. 

What are the type of Computer Memory which can be related to the Human Memory?
Random Access Memory (RAM): This is a type of computer memory that functions similarly to human short-term memory.
Solid State Drivers- SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs, but they are also more expensive.
